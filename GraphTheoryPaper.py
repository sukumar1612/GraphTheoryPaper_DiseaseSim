Glossary:

Vertex of graph -     

'trunc_gauss' - Normal distribution for a fixed range from bottom to top 
                i.e. in our case bottom = 0, top = n-1

line ( - ) - Input values
             effectiveness - actually 1-effectiveness

normal_community - An adjacency matrix that corresponds to a community
                   where there are no preventive measures against COVID


cautious_community - An adjacency matrix that corresponds to a community
                   where there are preventive measures against COVID

people_labels - List of people, here each person is identified by an integer 
                (0 to population -1)

mask_list - List of people who wear mask (Randomised)
sanitize_list - List of people who use sanitiser (Randomised)
social_dist_list - List of people who follow social distancing (Randomised)

prioritise and randomise -  sort the 'individuals_at_risk' list in non-decresing order to 
                            ensure that those who don't take a lot of 
                            preventive measures are sooner to get infected

                        -   randomise to ensure that the event of infection 
                            is a random event
